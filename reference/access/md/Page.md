**Type:** Class

**GUID:** {3B06E973-E47C-11CD-8701-00AA003F0F07}  

A Page object corresponds to an individual page on a tab control.

**Remarks:** A Page object is a member of a tab control's Pages collection. To return a reference to a particular Page object in the Pages collection, use any of the following syntax forms. You can create, move, or delete Page objects and set their properties either in Visual Basic or in form Design view. To create a new Page object in Visual Basic, use the Add method of the Pages collection. To delete a Page object, use the Remove method of the Pages collection. To create a new Page object in form Design view, right-click the tab control and then choose Insert Page on the shortcut menu. You can also copy an existing page and paste it. You can set the properties of the new Page object in form Design view by using the property sheet. Each Page object has a PageIndex property that indicates its position within the Pages collection. The Value property of the tab control is equal to the PageIndex property of the current page. Use these properties to determine which page is currently selected after the user has switched from one page to another, or to change the order in which the pages appear in the control. A Page object is also a type of Control object.

## Methods (5)

- `SizeToFit()`  
  Use the SizeToFit method to size a control so that it fits the text or image that it contains.
- `Requery()`  
  The Requery method updates the data underlying a specified control that's on the active form by requerying the source of data for the control.
- `SetFocus()`  
  The SetFocus method moves the focus to the specified form, the specified control on the active form, or the specified field on the active datasheet.
